### Hello, I have recently begun my role as the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. My job is to help the school board and the mayor make decisions regarding the district's budgets and priorities. My first project is analyzing the district's standardized test results. I will be aggregating the data to show trends regarding school performance.
