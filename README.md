# Py City Schools

Hello, I have recently begun my role as the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. My job is to help the school board and the mayor make decisions regarding the district's budgets and priorities. My first project is analyzing the district's standardized test results. I will be aggregating the data to show trends regarding school performance.

##### The Final Report will include:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Top Performing Schools
- Bottom Performing Schools
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

##### Due to the large amount of data I will not be able to use excel to run the report. Instead, I will be completeomg the task by using Pandas.
